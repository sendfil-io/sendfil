4. **Begin Task 11**: Responsive design improvements

## Live Testing Implementation Plan

### üß™ Phase 1: Calibration Testnet Configuration

**Goal**: Configure app to work with Filecoin Calibration testnet for safe testing

**Steps**:

1. **Update Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local for testnet
   VITE_RPC_URL=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1
   VITE_GLIF_RPC_URL_PRIMARY=https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1
   VITE_GLIF_RPC_URL_FALLBACK=https://calibration.filfox.info/rpc/v1
   ```

2. **Update wagmi Configuration**:
   - Add Filecoin Calibration testnet to chain config
   - Update chain validation in NetworkBanner component
   - Ensure f4 address conversion works with testnet

3. **Get Test FIL**:
   - Visit https://faucet.calibration.fildev.network/
   - Connect wallet and request test FIL
   - Verify balance appears in app

4. **Test Basic RPC Functions**:
   - Use "Transaction Testing" tab to verify RPC connection
   - Test wallet data retrieval (balance, nonce)
   - Validate all DataProvider functions work with testnet

### üîê Phase 2: Wallet Signing Integration

**Goal**: Complete the transaction signing flow with actual wallet signatures

**Steps**:

1. **Add Proper CBOR Encoding**:

   ```typescript
   // Current: JSON.stringify(message) - simplified
   // Needed: Proper Filecoin CBOR encoding for signing
   import { encode } from '@ipld/dag-cbor';
   ```

2. **Integrate wagmi Signing**:

   ```typescript
   // Use wagmi's signMessage hook
   const { signMessage } = useSignMessage();

   // Convert Filecoin message to proper signing format
   // Sign with wallet
   // Convert signature to Filecoin format
   ```

3. **Update Transaction Executor**:
   - Remove `dryRun: true` default
   - Integrate real wallet signing function
   - Handle signing errors and user cancellation
   - Add transaction confirmation UI

4. **Test Signing Flow**:
   - Test message signing with connected wallet

   - Test CSV parsing with malicious inputs

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with large CSV files (100+ recipients)
   - Monitor RPC call performance
   - Test fallback RPC functionality
   - Validate memory usage with large batches

3. **User Experience Testing**:
   - Test complete user journey from CSV upload to completion
